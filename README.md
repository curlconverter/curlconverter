# [curlconverter](https://curlconverter.com)

Transpile [`curl`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL) commands into Python and other languages.

Try it in the browser at [curlconverter.com](https://curlconverter.com) or from the command line:

```sh
$ curlconverter --data-raw "hello=world" example.com
import requests

data = {
    'hello': 'world',
}

response = requests.post('http://example.com', data=data)
```

Features:

- Understands most Bash syntax
  - [ANSI-C quoted strings](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#ANSI_002dC-Quoting)
  - Piped file or input (such as [heredocs](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Here-Documents))
  - Ignores comments
  - Reports syntax errors
- Knows about all of curl's 300 or so arguments, including deleted ones, but most are simply ignored
- Allows passing multiple short arguments in one, just like curl, e.g. `-vOXPOST`
- `--data @filename` generates Python code that reads from that file
- `--data @-` generates Python code that reads from stdin (or piped file/input)
- Converts JSON to native objects
- Warns about issues with the conversion

Limitations:

- Only HTTP is supported
- If multiple URLs are passed only the last one is used 
- Code generators for other languages are less thorough than the Python generator
- and much more

## Install

Install the JavaScript library for use in your own projects with

```sh
npm install curlconverter
```

Install the command line tool with

```sh
npm install --global curlconverter
```

curlconverter requires Node 14+.

## Usage

### Usage as a library

The JavaScript API is a bunch of functions that can take either a string of Bash code or an array (of already-parsed command line arguments) and return a string with the resulting program:

```js
import * as curlconverter from 'curlconverter';

curlconverter.toPython('curl example.com');
curlconverter.toPython(['curl', 'example.com']);
// "import requests\n\nresponse = requests.get('http://example.com')\n"
```

**Note**: add `"type": "module"` to your package.json for the `import` statement above to work.

Each function also has a corresponding function that returns a string with code and an array of warnings about any issues with the conversion:

``` js
curlconverter.toPythonWarn('curl ftp://example.com');
curlconverter.toPythonWarn(['curl', 'ftp://example.com']);
// [
//   "import requests\n\nresponse = requests.get('ftp://example.com')\n",
//   [ [ 'bad-scheme', 'Protocol "ftp" not supported' ] ]
// ]
```

If you use curlconverter in the browser, it needs two WASM files to work, `tree-sitter.wasm` and `tree-sitter-bash.wasm`, which it will request from the root directory of your web server. If you are hosting a static website and using Webpack, you need copy these files from the node_modules/ directory to your server's root directory in order to serve them. You can look at the [webpack.config.js](https://github.com/curlconverter/curlconverter.github.io/blob/2e1722891be22b1bb5c47976fb7873f6eb86b94d/webpack.config.js#L130-L131) for [curlconverter.com](https://curlconverter.com/) to see how this is done. You will also need to set `{module: {experiments: {topLevelAwait: true}}}` in your webpack.config.js.


### Usage from the command line

The command line tool is a drop-in replacement for curl. Take any `curl` command, change "`curl`" to "`curlconverter`" and it will print code instead of making the request. Alternatively, you can pass `-` to tell it to read the curl command from stdin.

``` sh
$ curlconverter example.com
$ echo 'curl example.com' | curlconverter -
```


You can choose the output language by passing `--language <language>`. The options are

- `ansible`
- `cfml`
- `csharp`
- `dart`
- `elixir`
- `go`
- `java`
- `javascript`, `node`, `node-axios`, `node-request`
- `json`
- `matlab`
- `php`, `php-request`
- `python` (the default)
- `r`
- `ruby`
- `rust`

### Usage in VS Code

There's a VS Code extension that adds a "Paste cURL as \<language\>" option to the right-click menu: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=curlconverter.curlconverter . It [uses an old version of curlconverter](https://github.com/curlconverter/curlconverter-vscode/issues/1), so it doesn't support the same languages, curl arguments or Bash syntax as the current version.
